because I am passionated about books, especially picture books,
I did a calendar, waiting for the Bologna Children's Book Fair, 6-9 March 2023, 60th edition, Bologna Italy:
it is a 5 days calendar, 1-5 March,
built with React and a lot of CSS;
it is full of colours, like purple and orange and red, as the BCBF's style,
and some things happen while hovering with the mouse around
and there are many links to discover.
take a look!
